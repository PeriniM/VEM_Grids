# Polygonal grids for Virtual Elements Method (VEM) 

## Abstract
Virtual Elements Method, unlike FEM, works with any kind of grid elements, from regular to non-regular shapes. Since it is a research field, there are not many resources and experimental grids need to be created to test this new algorithm. This method can be used to mesh very rough surfaces (like a rock with many irregular spikes and holes) and, from initial tests, faster than FEM on solving non-linear systems of equations.

## What is it?
List of Matlab scripts that generates polygonal (regular and irregular) grids with particular requirements to be applied to VEM solver.
